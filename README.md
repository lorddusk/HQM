# Hardcore Questing Mode

HQM is a minecraft mod that provides a questing system that
modpacks can utilize to guide players or reward progress.

HQM has a couple supporting features to complement the questing system:
- Teams: Support for teams of players that share quest progress
- Lives: Support for a hardcore-like system with lives that can be gained through items
- Loot bags: Openable reward items with loot tables that work slightly differently to vanilla loot tables 
- Reputations: Support for creating stats that can be used with quest rewards and quest conditions

The latest versions of the mod support both fabric and forge,
and can be downloaded from [curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/hardcore-questing-mode).
